                <p>
                    If you find any damage, you need to make necessary roof repairs as soon as possible.  Missing, cracked, or broken tiles are among the most common types of damage <a href="https://www.laroofingct.com/ct-storm-damage/">during storms</a>. By taking the <a href="https://www.laroofingct.com/install-a-new-roof/">time to inspect your roof</a> before a storm hits, you can minimize the potential for damage by repairing any tiles that are already damaged.  If you can’t make the nescessary roof repairs yourself, hire a professional to do it for you.

                <p>
                    If you experience roof damage, it’s important to take measures to protect your property from further damage. One way to do this is to put tarps over any holes in the roof. This will help prevent any further roof damage from occurring while you wait for repairs to be made.  Another way to protect your property is to remove any loose debris from around the perimeter of your home. This includes things like branches, leaves, and other yard waste. By removing these items, you can help prevent them from being blown into your home or business during a storm.

                    7. KEEP TRACK OF ALL EXPENSES RELATED TO REPAIRING THE DAMAGE
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When you experience damage to your roof, it’s important to keep track of all expenses related to repairing the damage. This includes things like the cost of materials, labor, and any other associated costs. Keeping track of these expenses can be helpful when filing an insurance claim.

                    8. DON'T MAKE ANY PERMANENT REPAIRS UNTIL YOU'VE SPOKEN WITH YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    If you experience damage to your roof, it’s important not to make any permanent repairs until you’ve spoken with your insurance company. This is because most insurance companies require that you get their approval before making any permanent repairs. By getting approval from your insurance company first, you can be sure that the repairs will be covered by your policy.
